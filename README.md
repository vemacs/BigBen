BigBen for Bukkit
=================

An in-progress clone for BigBen, but for Bukkit. It's written completely from scratch.

What works perfectly
--------------------

-Bonging every hour

-Correct number of bongs for UTC time

-Answering to player responses with CleverBot backend

-Customizable prefix

What's not implemented
----------------------

-Response overrides

-Permissions

-URL title reader

-Ability to spoof the bot

Features
--------

-Uses the same bonging method that the original BigBen uses

-Accurate bonging

Info
-------

This has been compiled with JRE6 and Bukkit 1.3.2 R3.0, it has been tested with Spigot 1.4.5 R0.3.

Thanks to TheCrittaC for the original concept and providing me the algorithm for bonging without constantly calling an if-loop.
